napari plugin of [NanoPyx](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoPyx) (the successor to NanoJ) - focused on light microscopy and super-resolution imaging.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## What is the NanoPyx ðŸ”¬ Library?

NanoPyx is a library specialized in the analysis of light microscopy and super-resolution data.
It is a successor to [NanoJ](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Core), which is a Java library for the analysis of super-resolution microscopy data.

NanoPyx focuses on performance, by heavily exploiting cython aided multiprocessing and simplicity. It implements methods for the bioimage analysis field, with a special emphasis on those developed by the [Henriques Laboratory](https://henriqueslab.github.io/).
It will be distributed as a Python Library and also as [Codeless Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoPyx#codeless-jupyter-notebooks-available), that can be run locally or on Google Colab, and as a [napari plugin](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/napari-NanoPyx).

You can read more about NanoPyx in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.13.553080v1).

Currently it implements the following approaches:
- A reimplementation of the NanoJ image registration, SRRF and Super Resolution metrics
- eSRRF
- Non-local means denoising
- More to come soonâ„¢
